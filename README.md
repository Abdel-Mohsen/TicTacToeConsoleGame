# Tic-Tac-Toe-Console-Game

Tic-Tac-Toe is a very simple two player game. So only two players can play at a time. This game is also known as Xs and Os game. the first player plays with X and the second player plays with O. In this game I used C# console app.

## Getting Started

<p >
Go ahead and download the zip file then open the .sln file. You will have the full project click run and you should see this screen : 
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="Img/55.PNG" alt="TicTacToe"/>
</p>

<p> Enter a field number and it will automatically replace the field number with the player sign X or O as you see in this screen:<p/>

<p align="center">
    <img src="Img/56.PNG" alt="TicTacToe"/>
</p>
<p> If one of the players enters an existing field number a message will display to make the players choose another field. <p/>

</p>


<p>After all fields assigned to player signs Xs and Os you will have one of the three results : 
<p align="center">

</p>
<ol>
  <li>Player ONE Won</li>
  <li>Player TWO Won</li>
  <li>Draw No Winners</li>
</ol> 
<p/>
<p>After one of those results you can press anykey to reset the game and play again.
<p/>


## Prerequisites

## Code
<p>In this project I used: 
 <ol>
  <li>Multidimensional array (2D array).</li>
  <li>Methods.</li>
  <li>Loops.</li>
  <li>conditions. (if condition & switch case)</li>
  <li>Exception Handling.</li>
</ol> 
<p/>

<p>
   It consists of four methods:
     <p align="center">

</p>
<ol>
  <li>DrawFields() :  this method is responsible for drawing a 2D array that contains the set of fields to shape the playground Fields.</li>
  <li>Play() :  this method is responsible for the game rules and the play techniques. </li>
  <li>XorO(char playerSign,int input) :  this method takes two parameters and check which field the player has choosen to replace it with the player sign (X or O).</li>
  <li>ResetPlaygroundFields() :  this method is responsible for resetting the 2D array to it's first shape and re-draw the fields on the console.</li>
</ol>
